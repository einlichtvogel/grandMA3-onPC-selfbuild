# grandMA3-onPC-selfbuild

Hey folks!

After using many different lighting consoles over the years, I have finally found my favorite one: the grandMA3.
Since I am more of a hobbyist and not a professional, I cannot afford spending thousands of euros on a command wing. So I decided to build my own grandMA3 onPC system.
That's why I created this repository. I want to share my knowledge and experience with you, so you can build your own grandMA3 onPC system as well.

Big shoutout to MA Lighting for creating such a great product and for providing the grandMA3 onPC software. 

## What is grandMA3 onPC?
grandMA3 onPC is a software lighting control system that runs on a computer and **can** be controlled using MA Hardware or a self built system like described here. It's a powerful tool that can control up to 4,096 parameters. The perfect solution for small to medium-sized shows, installations, and events.
